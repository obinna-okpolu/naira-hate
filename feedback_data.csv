Ebi is killing more people in PH than Ibadan. That I can assua you
Why will I cry over Fubara. He's still gov looting away while the ordinary Rivers man is still waiting for the mandate
Abeg how is it now my consign?  
[b]You're not even suppose to be taking about governance when other Nigerians are taking, even by Nigerias low standard, your GSM is a failure. The other day, I drove past a decrepit government secondary school in ikolaba which is at the heart of the city and very close to the government house and I shuddered. If a school at that spot can be in such a state, just imagine how schools will be in Ibarapa, oyo town, ogbomosho and other obscure places   yet you and other Sycoppphant who have never experienced good governance keep hailing the man. There's no place in the entire Rivers state where people congregate to beg like its done in 1w0 road and other parts of your state, travel so that at least you can see how other people live. Even in our villages, our roads are neater, well paved with street lights, our people look neater and well kept(even the poor), we have fairly good power supply, beautiful houses are being built in the villages compared to some places where there's little to no electricity in the capital city yet you have the loudest voice in the room. The man is so stingy, he instructs LGA Chairmen to send them their allocation while he gives them a paltry 5m. He eats alone and pretends to be a good man. Come down to Rivers, the wike you hate has empowered and made over 100 individuals billionaires and it has trickled down to the grassroot, beautiful houses are being built, businesses are springing up and families are being liberated financially, begging on the road is a taboo here and im not sure same cannot be said from the places where some loudmouths hail from    [/b]",NEUTRAL

Ridiculous.

They are two very different countries - one in the West and the other at the Southern tip of the continent. Lets start with the ecology - the flora and fauna in Nigeria are different from South Africa's - needless to say, there are several things unique to each country. Is it clear to you now?

If you notice, I was careful not to make any assumptions about what you meant in your comment about South Africa not having anything Nigeria lacks. I also didn't ask you to explain - and that was deliberate.

This online 'war' between Nigeria and South Africa is ridiculous and utterly pointless. Both countries have their peculiar problems - some of them very, very serious. The focus should be on fixing them.
This is the first time you are talking like a true African, because in Nigeria we believe that, even if we have everything,we are still very poor ,if our African brothers are poor and insecured, so for that reason,we should stop hating ourselves more than Asians or Americans hate us",NEUTRAL
